<h1>About College Tracker</h1>
<p>College Tracker is an app designed for international high school students that are interested in applying to colleges in the U.S. Many bright and motivated students abroad speak English, but are intimidated by the American application process because they know very little about it. College Tracker showcases a list of some undergraduate institutions for students to browse through. Students may sign up and keep track of colleges they wish to apply to by adding it to their favorites list.</p>
